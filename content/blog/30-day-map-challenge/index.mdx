# Daily social mapping project in November 2020

[](./images/30DayMapChallenge.jpeg)

The idea is to create (and publish) maps based on different themes on
each day of the month using the hashtag #30DayMapChallenge, You can
prepare the maps beforehand, but the main idea is to publish maps from
specific topics on specific days listed below. Just include a picture
of the map when you post to Twitter with the hashtag. You don't have
to sign up anywhere to participate. There are no restrictions on the
tools, technologies and the data you use in your maps. Doing less than
30 is also fine (and actually doing all 30 is really hard!). See the
code of conduct at the bottom of the page
