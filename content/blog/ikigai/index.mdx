In the age of TLDR; and days before the pandemic I came across the
fancy foreign term you see as the title of this article -- the first
of many.

_Ikigai_, or _the value one finds in day-to-day living_.

[Nicholas Kemp] has a great Medium thinkpiece tracking ikigai's
advancing popularity in the West, from borrowed concept to clarion
call in Andr√©s Zuzunaga's originally unlabeled [Venn Diagram of
Purpose], Dan Buettner's [Blue Zones], and Marc Winn's [World Changing
Blog]

Mid-March, I discovered Scott Spence's [digital garden] -- and after
stealing much of the source behind his website -- decided to begin
cultivating my own (Thank you, Scott).

If you're reading this now, I've left myself little time to expand on
this inaugural post per my self-imposed deadline.

Yes I am building this plane while flying it.

More to come soon, my friends.
